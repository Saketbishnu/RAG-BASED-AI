Forms are an important element of websites because you submit data through the form from client to server. These are the forms that you see on the contact pages, on Google forms or inquiry forms. On the flight or railway ticket, you submit all the details through the HTML forms. In the last video, many people liked it. I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course. So, let's go to the computer screen and see the forms, input tags and some best practices. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to the computer screen. And now, I am going to make a folder here. The name of the folder is Video6. Because this is a 6th video. I will download it and open it with code. I have already told you all this. And here, I am going to make index.html. And by putting the exclamation mark on it, I will do the view, wrap, screen, mode, and you see here, I will write forms. Let's learn it. So, I have set the title of the form page here. And what happened by setting the title is that the title will be shown on our page. Here, I want to tell you about a very important setting, the show preview. People in the bar have also pointed out to me that you have to click so many times. So, can you do something? Yes, you can. Here, you click on the gear, click on the settings. And after clicking on the settings, what you do simply is, write here, live preview, live preview. And we can actually set it. When we click on it, what will happen is that it will open on the external browser. So, now, I will close everything. As soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser. And I come to the browser. And the play list of Sigma Web Development Coats is on the iXS Star. And here, on the bookmark. But now, I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, it will open. So, if you want, do it like this. But sometimes, you want to prefer side by side view. And when will you want to do that when you are actually using HTML, CSS, or working on design. So, whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see the live preview here. Which is why this extension was made. And it was made differently from the live server. That is why it will be seen in the side view. Now, what will we do here? We will go about forms. What is form? You know the name of form. It means the form of the Railway. We fill it and it will be our reservation. Along with that, we fill the IDJ form. We fill the need form. We fill any exam form. So that we can reach our data to the person who wants it. So, this is form. HTML is a form tag. So, you will write form. You will enter. So, the first question will be about your form action. Get or post? I will tell you a very quick difference between get request and post request. I will tell you a quick difference between get request and post request. Get request is a very simple request. And post request is sent when we have to give a lot of data. Whenever we have to give a form, we will use post request in most of the cases. And what is get request? It is a very simple request. We just have to tell the server and that's it. Or we have to hit the server with a request. That's it. But if you don't understand this, that should be fine. There is no problem. Because we are going to do this in detail. So, form action is equal to post. I wrote it here. Now, I can show you some input tags. I will tell you the input tags. What are the elements inside your form? Like you can put a date, you can put it in form. You can put your name, phone number, age, etc. You can put these things in form. So, I want to tell you that you put input tags in form. And a label tag which is used to label that input. So, what I will do here is, the simplest input tag is type is equal to text. So, I will put type is equal to text input here. And if I zoom out here, So, type is equal to text name is equal to user name. Place will enter user name. And it will look like this in actual. You can say enter your user name. And the user name you have in front of you, you have to enter the user name. I will write an h1 here. And I will write here. Malo form to apply for ta for sigma web dev ta. Sigma web development codes ta. Malo, we are hiring teaching assistants for sigma web development codes. So, we can write here something like this. By the way, I have put subtitles. If you haven't done playlist, then do access it. And along with that, I will show you something else. The subtitles are quite funny. You can write on sigma badge and you can play village land. I mean, if you are watching a young race, or if you are watching a person who doesn't know Hindi at all, you can say, it's okay till here and give your village land to me. It's quite easy to see this thing. Anyway, you can see here that I have put the h1 here. Because it's our main heading. Enter your user name. This is our input tag. Along with input tag, we use the label tag. Now, whose label is this? I will write its id in 4 is equal to. Malo, I will write its id username. And what will I do in 4 is equal to? I will put it in 4 is equal to its id. Now, what is id here? I will tell you this later. For now, you just have to understand that this element has a unique identifier. To identify this element uniquely, your id number cannot be of any other kind. Similarly, this id username can't be found by anyone else. This is the id. I will tell you more in detail. Consider it as big. So, I have written label 4 is equal to username. I have written input here. And you can see here that the label will come here. I am looking here. I didn't put anything in the label. So, I will put enter your username. And you can see here, as soon as I put it here, you will get to see enter your username. After that, you can enter your username here. And you can also enter your expertise here. Consider me asking here what is your gender. So, I can do something like this here. And you see, enter your gender. And as soon as I did this, I can ask you from the male or female. What is it? Now, what happens here is that sometimes we wrap it in div. What is div? Div is our block element. Okay. And what are the inline block elements? I haven't told you this in this course yet. But I will tell you in the coming videos. So, for now, you just have to understand this. I am putting it in div to give it a new space. Okay. So, as soon as I put it in div, it will come to the new space. Yes, there is a br tag too. Okay, br tag is also there, which is the inline block element. But I don't prefer br tag. And you will get to know why. Why we don't want to bloat our HTML from br tag. You will get to know this in the coming videos. Now, you see here, enter your username, here, male or female. Now, here, as soon as I am clicking on female, this radio button is selected. I am clicking on male, it is selected. Why is this happening? Because the label of it, I have put for is equal to female and here, I have put id female. You see here. And also, I have put the same name of these two. Because the name is equal to gender, I have also put this input tag. And the name is equal to gender, I have also put this input radio tag. And as soon as we have written type is equal to radio, this means that the radio button is there. And if we have done the same name of it, then only one of these two can be selected at a time. If I have selected this, then it will be like this. If I have selected this, then it will be like this. Now, let me show you one thing. If I am making the id in the form of the label, then I will make it wrong. And here in the form of id, I don't make it wrong in the first one, I make it wrong in the second one. So, when I click on the second one, then it will not be selected. I am clicking, it is not selected. I am clicking on the mail, it is selected. So, to select the female, I will have to click here. See, you all. So, what I should do is, always for is equal to, the input tag should be put as id. So, you all can see, here I have put the label for is equal to female. Along with that, we have an input tag, which is type is equal to checkbox. Now, see here, if I put the input of type is equal to checkbox. I will put it in the div, and right click on it, and I will do the format document. Our document will be very good. That is, its formatting and all that. It will be very good. Now, see here, here, subscribe to newsletter. Here, I can check it. And in the radio button and checkbox, the difference is that you can check the checkbox. Different checkbox. Here, if you want, you can select it from the male or female, or any of the options. After this, we have the text area, and the select tag. And I will show you that too. What happens is, the text area and the select tag works like this. Like I am copying the text area here. I will put it here and show you the text area. The text area input type is equal to text. But in this, the rows and columns are attributed. Which helps you to make the size smaller. Now, see here, the placeholder I have given here, enter your comment here. So, I have given the text of the text here. Ideally, we will keep it empty. Or at least we will not give it a new line. So, I will hide it here. Enter your comment here. And now, it will reach to the left side. I will show you. So, it has reached to the left side. Enter your comment here. And here, any user can put their comment. Now, see here, the content of the text area is entered here. So, the idea is, you do not want to keep the text area empty. And you want to put a label. And you can say, label for is equal to comment. And we will definitely put id here. Whenever we put for, it is in the form of for. The element for which it is, is its id. Okay. Now, see here. Enter your comment here. So, what will happen? I will write enter your comment. Enter your comment here. Now, you will see, this is not styled properly. This is not styled properly. Because we will style it with CSS later. For now, I will just put br tag. But I do not recommend br tag. I am telling you again. I do not recommend br tag. Because br tags are difficult. By the way, you should know br tag. Line break tag is something like this. You are doing everything right now. What is the problem with br tag? But I will tell you. Br tag is something that I do not recommend. Okay. This is not to be used. But I do not recommend using it all the time. What happens now? People find it easiest to put br tag. And add new spaces. I post this a lot. So, I will copy it. I will show you the select tag. Something like this. And you see here. As soon as I put select tag here. I put it in div. So, in select, you get some options. The syntax of select is something like this. Make apple. And you can use any of the three options. Now you see here. Anyone of the three can use it. And here I did what? Value is equal to apple. First I made a select tag. Name is equal to fruits. Then option value is equal to apple. Option value is equal to banana. Option value is equal to cherry. When we pass this form data. I will tell you in the JavaScript part. How to send this data to the server. There are many things that are still left about form. I will tell you. So, stay tuned for that. Okay. So, this was about forms. I had to tell you all the elements of form in this video. And along with that, I have told you all the select tags and all the things. About form, these other attributes. I have told you the action. You can submit the form from any action. Where will you handle the form? You can give that data here. Then there is a method. Get request or post request. I will tell you in the video of difference between these two. But I have told you in a very rough way. Get request is a very simple request. Post request is used only when the data is sent. Because the limit of get request is there. You can send a lot of data in the post request. Okay. We don't even send passwords in the get request. We send it along with the post request. Okay. Now, here I have told you the method. What is the name? Name is equal to user name. I mean, we mark it with the name. If we mark it with the name, the server will know what is the corresponding value of the key. So, the key value and the server will go according to the name. Its name and value will go. Okay. So, we will see this when we do server side processing. What is the meaning of placeholder? What will be written in it? Like, here, see the entry and user name is placeholder. I will click on it. So, this entry and user name is not written in it. I will write anything. See, it came. But, the entry and user name is just telling me here. I have to put the user name in it. Then, what is required after this? You have to require it. You will have to put it. The value of it will not be there. Otherwise, your form will not be submitted. So, we will use this a lot. Then, after this, we have autofocus. What autofocus does? Autofocus automatically focuses the cursor. So, I will show you the magic of autofocus. So, if you have written here input tag in autofocus. Okay. So, the entry and user name is autofocus. I will reload it. So, you see, I will type it. It will automatically focus on it. So, autofocus means that you type whenever you type. It will be typed here. Okay. I hope you understand what I am saying. Now, validation attribute. I have told you the requirement here. You can give a pattern in which you can give a regular expression pattern. Now, don't confuse people. Don't say that you don't know what you are saying. You don't know the expression. So, I am sitting here. I will teach you all things. So, you understand that we will accept a particular pattern. If we put the pattern equal to this, you cannot put it apart from this pattern. Okay. So, you should know this thing here. So, I hope you are enjoying this video. And along with that, I will write a sigma batch OP in the comment section. And in the first video, please review this course. Because, still, many people ask me that should I do this course or not? If it is free course, people don't value it. They say that this course is free. So, we should watch it or take a paid course. And I would like to give a note for those who asked me to take a paid course. What should I do now? Take the money or join the sigma batch. You all join the sigma batch. Cut your losses and join the sigma batch. Because, look, what is the quality of this course. I don't think you need to tell me. So, you all come and do this. Everything you will get here. I am telling you. Free means, you will be selling this course for 10,000 rupees. Yes, that was the amount we fixed. I was going to sell this course for 10,000 rupees. And I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course. If anyone is selling, there is nothing wrong in selling any course. But the thing is, if you buy another course and you still feel that sigma is a great course then you should join. Cut your losses and join. Because if you make your career once, then you will not find anything like this in the future. If you look back in the time when you came, then you will also say, yes, we took a paid course. Then we took a pre-course, which we understood. And if your career is made, then everything will not matter in the future. So, do what is right for you. And do your work understanding your mistakes. I hope you understand things. So, like the video, access the playlist, subscribe to the channel. And write sigma batch OP in the comment section below. Write down your village and uncle's land in my name. That's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
