  "text": " In today's video, we will learn about Core Web Vitals and why Core Web Vitals are necessary. Like this video and keep high energy. The thing is that your website should be in your iPhone, iPad, Android, Surface Pro 4 devices. Because we have to give good experience to all users through our website. In this video, we will also learn about Chrome's hidden tool which is called Lighthouse. How can you use it to enhance your website. In the comment section, write down Sigma Batch OP. Let's go to the computer screen and let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And I will make a new folder which is called Video 6. Video 6. And in Video 6, I will click on VS Code as always. And today, I am going to tell you about SEO. First of all, I want to tell you what SEO is. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. You can see any website and it has SEO. Let's take an example of Amazon.in. I opened Amazon.in and I wanted to download this website as soon as possible. So that they can get their products in the search. Google is a search engine. Google's responsibility is to show good pages to users. So Google will only show those pages which will be fast. They present good information and along with that, there are some things which are good for users. For example, there are two pages from the editor. One page has told about Dogfood. The other page has also told about Dogfood. But among these two, page 2 is very fast and loads well. So Google will give more preference to it. Along with that, there are core web vitals which Google considers to rank two pages. First of all, content is the most important. If your content is good, you can rank it without the code web vitals. But if you are competing with a page with the same content, which has a similar quality content, then your core web vitals will be seen. If your core web vitals are good, you will be given preference. So the first thing that comes in core web vitals is your CLS. Look at this video which I have run on the web.dev website. You will see that someone comes to your website and in order to cancel it, the error that was made by the person who canceled it, the above thing became visible. And it shifted the layout. And the order was completed. But if the user wanted the order to be completed, he wanted to click on it. In this way, the user experience is very bad. And as you saw in this video, this shouldn't happen. That's why our CLS should be at least. Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative layout shift means, how much the page is shifting while loading. Suppose you have loaded the page and you get to see this first. This was above and after that, when this load was loaded, then all this shifted down. The layout shouldn't shift. If you put vit and ride in images, then the layout shouldn't shift. The next metric we are going to talk about is LCP. And LCP stands for largest contextual paint. This means that if the user is viewing a page, then the biggest element is on it. For example, the biggest part in this is this image. How long does it load? The entire page will be loaded. But the biggest element which is most important is how long does it load? The meaning of web.dev and Google is a good LCP score. It should be 2.5 seconds. Meaning, the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds. Then comes the third metric which is FID. Which stands for First Input Delay. The first input delay means that if a user clicks on an input element, like on the button or any type of input given on a page, then how long does that input process take? For example, if you click on a button, then the button click browser processes in how long? And the meaning of Google and web.dev is that it should start processing in less than 100 milliseconds. So these were the three core web vitals which are very important. I will tell you for the information that these core web vitals are updated too. But these are very important and you should know. Now I will show you what the Lighthouse report is and why it is generated. And how will you get these core web vitals value from there? So I will tell you here. If you will inspect it right click and you can see that it is coming on the right side. So you can click here and drag it down. You can drag it down again and drag it down. I prefer to drag it down because it is my habit to look down from the beginning. Now here you can see the option of Lighthouse. Lighthouse basically generates a report and tells you what can be improved in your HTML page. For example, if I want to see in mobile that how mobile users see my website, then I will click on mobile or I will click on desktop and close this tab. I will click on mobile and here I will click on analyze page load. So this will generate a report for me. You can see that a report is generated here. Performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO and PWA are all shown here. Now here you can see that some things are showing in red. That is the scope of improvement is in the page. Now here you are telling that you should size your images properly. 2.7 seconds fast your website can be loaded. So all these suggestions are given to you by Lighthouse. And if you incorporate these suggestions, then your website will be loaded very well and the user will have a good experience. Now you can see that image elements do not have explicit width and height. So you should give width and height. The width and height attribute of image that we read in the last video should be used. So that it is reserved in your browser. When we set width and height in HTML, then space in the browser is reserved. Otherwise, if we do not set height and width, then what will happen is that the browser will not tell us how much space we have to reserve. And the longer the CSS load, the lower the page will shift. So we do not want our page to shift in loading time. If our page starts shifting, then if we click here, then when it shifts from the wrong side, then it can be done. We click here and sit. Suppose there was an image going here, I click here. And the time I clicked here, this image is loaded and all these buttons are shifted down. And instead of clicking here, I will click on the image. This is called cumulative layout shift. So this kind of shift is not preferred at all. Google does not prefer it at all. And this should be at least. You can see that the space is very less. So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift at least. So that our user can get a very good experience. So here we get a lot of other suggestions. And this is for our mobile. Now we can generate desktop reports. So as you can see, it has generated a report. It has 92 marks in performance. It has given 100 out of 100 in accessibility. In best practices, 75 in SEO, 75. Now here you can see that whatever good things are told here. And whatever light house you tell. So this is a hidden tool that we should use. Now I want to tell you about meta tags and meta description. So what I will do here is I will make a new file. I will name it index.html. And after making one HTML file, The first SEO element that I want to tell you is title. Your title reflects your page content. So this is a very good SEO practice. Whenever your page change is happening, Make the title like this. That reflects your page content. Because if you want your website on Google, Then it will come according to the title. From Google's index, you can write code with Harry. And you write like this. This is the title of the page. And this is the title of the page. This is the title of the page. This is the title of the page. This is the title of the page. And the title reflects your page content. Truly, then your website will rank very well. Now here I will put the content. I will put an H1 and write Harry. And after that I will write a paragraph. And here I will write Lorem45. Now I have written Lorem45. I will write the view word. Why did I write 45? This is a very good question. I wrote 45 because I am in the Alcio and 4 or 5. So I have given 4 or 5. I will write 23 as well. There is no other reason. Now I will quickly preview it. I will open it and browse it. This document is written. If I leave it like this, then it will not be a good practice. I will write about Harry. And I will write code with Harry. And what will happen if I do this? The title will reflect here. As you can see. So what will happen if I do this? My website will increase in the chances of seeing in Google. After inspecting it, I will also take out its light of the report. And I will see what is the scope of improvement. The light of the report will be very good. Because there is no such thing that I should improve. But when I put images, I will get suggestions. Like put width, height. Along with that, I will tell you another trick. By which you can see your website in any mobile. By which you can see your website in any mobile. You can see how your website looks in mobile. You will be able to know. So you people click here. You can see the computer here. And if you choose responsive in it. You can see how your website will look in any device. So your website is responsive. Or you can see it here. If you are going to see in a specific device. Like in iPhone 12 Pro. Your website iPhone 12 Pro. Resolution will look something like this. Now don't say why it is not 15 or 16. 12 Pro means big iPhone device. Understand it. In such a big device. How will your website look. You are just telling it. Now you can see. How will you see in Surface Pro 7. By clicking here. How will it look on Google phones. You can also find this. If you want to take a general view. In my website responsive device. In any device. In iPad. How will it look. If you don't have a device here. Take out the approximate width. You will get all the width devices. Your website should look good. How will it look. I will tell you this in this course. Now you click here again. This is closed. The responsive view is closed. As soon as it is closed. Your website looks like this. I will close it. I will come back here. I will tell you about meta text. Here I will write meta. This is a page about. This is a page which contains. Description. About Harry. Ok. And here you can write any page content. Whatever you want. Suppose you write what is SEO. What is SEO. You wrote. This page has put this meta description. SEO stands for this in simple terms. Now it is not necessary that a search engine. Passes your meta DSE. If it looks good. If you have not put meta DSE. Then it can be generated from your content. So this is the responsibility of a search engine. What will Bing do. What will Google do. We don't know. But our page should be exactly to the point. Especially if we are writing a blog. And we want to rank our page. You can see here. I have put meta DSE. Now a meta keyword used to be used. But now the meta keyword. It has been deprecated. Meta keyword is not used now. Meta keyword looks like this. But it is believed that meta keywords Do not rank in SEO. Because people abuse it. Suppose you have written a page about pets. And you have written what is SEO. Meta keyword will rank in SEO. I will correct this double quote. If I put meta keyword here. Then it is not necessary that a search engine will do it. Some search engines do this. They say don't put meta keywords. Meta keywords used to be used a lot. But it is not. And now the time is coming. Especially if you understand your content. What is your content value. It will be ranked accordingly. Now if you want to know about these core web vitals. For example if I do it rightfully. And go to lighthouse. And take out lighthouse report for desktop. Some core web vitals come. Like LCP comes. Then FCP comes. First contextual paint. Now you can see here. Everything is 100% here. You can see that. Pages with web socket cannot enter Back, Forward, Cache. Because we are using extension. Live preview. Accessibility is also 100%. Everything is 100%. PWA is progressive web apps. But you can see here. First contextual paint. Total blocking time. Cumulative layout. Speed index. If you want to know about all this. What is the first contextual paint. Now it is on browser. If you want to see this. You have to go to web.dev. Web.dev is a very good website. You can see here. You can learn about this. What is the thing about these things. If you want to learn PWA. You can learn PWA. There is a lot of content here. But we will focus on making HTML, CSS, JavaScript and websites. According to me. You should know this.

Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. ."
